# useSize

A React [hook] for components that care about their size.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @hzcore/hook-size
```

## Usage

```js
import useSize from '@hzcore/hook-size';
```

`useSize` has two different modes of usage: **stateful** and **stateless**.
(See [stateful] and [stateless] for more on why and when to use which).

Additionally, `useSize` supports using an existing [ref object].
(See [shared ref / ref forwarding] for more).

This means `useSize` has 4 different signatures:

```ts
// Stateful — returns a size state and a callback ref to attach to a DOM node.
function useSize(): [Size, (node: HTMLElement | null) => void];

// Stateful with a provided ref object — returns a size state.
function useSize(providedRef: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>): Size;

// Stateless with a handler - returns a callback ref to attach to a DOM node.
function useSize(
  handler: (size: Size) => void,
): (node: HTMLElement | null) => void;

// Stateless with a handler and a provided ref object - returns nothing!
function useSize(
  providedRef: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>,
  handler: (size: Size) => void,
): void;
```

## Stateful

Sometimes a component wants to simply update whenever the size changes.
In these cases, `useSize` provides a **stateful** API.

### Stateful Example

To `useSize` statefully, call `useSize` without any arguments.
It will return an array containing a [Size] state and a [callback ref]:

```ts
function useSize(): [Size, (node: HTMLElement | null) => void];
```

The returned [callback ref] should be attached to the DOM element to be measured.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const SizeStateUser = () => {
      const [size, ref] = useSize();
      return (
        <div
          ref={ref}
          style={{
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            flex: 1,
            display: 'flex',
            justifyContent: 'center',
            alignItems: 'center',
          }}
        >
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(size, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      );
    };
    return <SizeStateUser />;
  }}
</Playground>

### Stateful Example with an Existing Ref

To `useSize` statefully with an existing [ref object], pass it to `useSize`.
It will return _just_ a [Size] state
(_not_ an array):

```ts
function useSize(providedRef: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>): Size;
```

The existing [ref object] should be attached to the DOM element to be measured.

> **Note:** Using an existing ref object has some possible gotchas.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const SizeStateUser = () => {
      // Since we aren't using a callback ref from `useSize`,
      // we use `useRefCallback()` to rerender whenever
      // the ref's current value changes.
      const [ref, setRef] = useRefCallback();
      const size = useSize(ref);
      return (
        <div
          ref={setRef}
          style={{
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            flex: 1,
            display: 'flex',
            justifyContent: 'center',
            alignItems: 'center',
          }}
        >
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(size, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      );
    };
    return <SizeStateUser />;
  }}
</Playground>

## Stateless

Sometimes (often for performance reasons), a component wants to derive state
from size changes, or debounce or otherwise throttle updates caused by changes.
In these cases, `useSize` provides a **stateless** API.

### Stateless Example

To `useSize` statelessly, call `useSize` with a [handler] function.
It will return _just_ a [callback ref] (_not_ an array):

```ts
function useSize(
  handler: (size: Size) => void,
): (node: HTMLElement | null) => void;
```

The returned [callback ref] should be attached to the DOM element to be measured.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const SizeUser = () => {
      // We use a state setter as our callback for demo purposes.
      // This is just to rerender whenever `useSize` calls it.
      const [size, setSize] = React.useState(null);
      const ref = useSize(setSize);
      return (
        <div
          ref={ref}
          style={{
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            flex: 1,
            display: 'flex',
            justifyContent: 'center',
            alignItems: 'center',
          }}
        >
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(size, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      );
    };
    return <SizeUser />;
  }}
</Playground>

### Stateless Example With an Existing Ref

To `useSize` statelessly with an existing [ref object], pass the [ref object]
and a [handler] function. It will return `undefined` (_not_ an array):

```ts
function useSize(
  ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>,
  handler: (size: Size) => void,
): void;
```

The existing [ref object] should be attached to the DOM element to be measured.

> **Note:** Using an existing ref object has some possible gotchas.
>
> See [Shared Ref / Ref Forwarding] for more.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const SizeUser = () => {
      // We use a state setter as our callback for demo purposes.
      // This is just to rerender whenever `useSize` calls it.
      const [size, setSize] = React.useState(null);
      // Since we aren't using a callback ref from `useSize`,
      // we use `useRefCallback()` to rerender whenever
      // the ref's current value changes.
      const [ref, setRef] = useRefCallback();
      useSize(ref, setSize);
      return (
        <div
          ref={setRef}
          style={{
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            flex: 1,
            display: 'flex',
            justifyContent: 'center',
            alignItems: 'center',
          }}
        >
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(size, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      );
    };
    return <SizeUser />;
  }}
</Playground>

## Shared Ref / Ref Forwarding

> **Note:** Using an existing ref object has a possible gotcha:
> `useSize` cannot know when the current value has changed!
> This means the component is responsible for rerendering
> whenever the the ref's value has been changed.
> One easy way to achieve this is with [useRefCallback].
> See the existing ref examples above for more.

Sometimes a component needs to [forward a ref] to its children,
or [use a ref][useref] with other hooks.
To support these cases, `useSize` accepts an optional [ref object].

It could be used with ref forwarding like:

```js
const SomeRefForwardingComponent = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
  // We pass `forwardedRef` (which _must_ be a ref object)
  // via the `ref` option to `useSize`.
  // Note that a calblack ref will _not_ be returned.
  // Note also that `useSize` won't be notified if the ref's
  // current value has changed, so it is up to this component
  // (or a parent component) to rerender whenever that happens.
  // In this example, we `useRefCallback` to solve this.
  const size = useSize(forwardedRef);
  const [, setRef] = useRefCallback(forwardedRef);
  return <div ref={setRef}>{JSON.stringify(size, null, 2)}</div>;
});
```

or, with `useRef`:

```js
const SomeRefUsingComponent = () => {
  // Create our own ref to use.
  const ref = React.useRef(null);
  // We pass our own ref via the `ref` option to `useSize`.
  // Note that a callback ref will _not_ be returned.
  // Note also that `useSize` won't be notified if the ref's
  // current value has changed, so it is up to this component
  // to rerender whenever that happens. In this example,
  // we `useRefCallback` to solve this.
  const size = useSize(ref);
  const [, setRef] = useRefCallback(ref);
  return <div ref={setRef}>{JSON.stringify(size, null, 2)}</div>;
};
```

## Handler

`handler: (size: Size) => void,`

A function to handle size updates.
Receives the latest [Size]. This is passed to `useSize` when
a component has a [stateless] use case. For simpler [stateful] use cases,
no handler is necessary.

## Size

The `Size` object is a [DOMRect]-like object with additional
`vw` and `vh` measurements, where `vw` is the [DOMRect] width as a
percentage of the viewport width, and `vh` is the [DOMRect] height
as a percentage of the viewport height.

```ts
interface Size {
  /** The x coordinate of the DOMRect's origin. */
  x: number;
  /** The y coordinate of the DOMRect's origin. */
  y: number;
  /** The width of the DOMRect. */
  width: number;
  /** The height of the DOMRect. */
  height: number;
  /**
   * The top coordinate value of the DOMRect
   * (has the same value as y, or y + height if height is negative.)
   */
  top: number;
  /**
   * The right coordinate value of the DOMRect
   * (has the same value as x + width, or x if width is negative.)
   */
  right: number;
  /**
   * The bottom coordinate value of the DOMRect
   * (has the same value as y + height, or y if height is negative.)
   */
  bottom: number;
  /**
   * The left coordinate value of the DOMRect
   * (has the same value as x, or x + width if width is negative.)
   */
  left: number;
  /**
   * The DOMRect width as a percentage of the viewport width
   * (where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%.)
   */
  vw: number;
  /**
   * The DOMRect height as a percentage of the viewport height
   * (where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%.)
   */
  vh: number;
}
